## Integration Features

### Phase 2 Game Logic Integration
- **Combat System**: Direct integration with `CombatEngine` for attack processing
- **Placement Logic**: Visual integration with `DragDropHandler` and validation systems
- **Ability System**: Connection to `AbilityEngine` for special ability activation
- **Validation**: Uses existing placement and combat validators

### Canvas System Integration (TASK-015)
- **Coordinate Transform**: Uses `CanvasCoordinateTransform` for screen-to-grid conversion
- **Event Handling**: Integrates with `CanvasEventHandler` for unified event management
- **Performance**: Leverages performance optimization systems
- **Responsive**: Adapts to canvas size changes and device capabilities

### Visual Rendering Integration (TASK-016)
- **Ship Rendering**: Builds upon existing ship sprite and rendering systems
- **Animation Engine**: Uses established animation patterns and configurations
- **Visual Consistency**: Maintains naval theme and design system
- **Layer Management**: Proper layering with existing rendering components

## Performance Optimizations

### 60fps Interactive Performance
- **Memoized Components**: All expensive calculations cached with `useMemo`
- **Optimized Animations**: Frame-rate aware animations with performance fallbacks
- **Efficient Event Handling**: Debounced hover effects and click detection
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of timeouts and event listeners

### Mobile Optimization
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px touch targets per WCAG guidelines
- **Gesture Support**: Native touch gesture recognition
- **Performance Scaling**: Automatic quality reduction on lower-end devices
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to screen size and orientation changes

## Technical Achievements

### Code Quality
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: 100% type safety with zero `any` types
- **ESLint Compliance**: All linting errors resolved
- **File Size Management**: All files under 350 line limit
- **Component Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns

### Accessibility Features
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility support
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and roles
- **High Contrast**: Visual feedback works in high contrast modes
- **Touch Accessibility**: Appropriate touch target sizing

### Integration Architecture
- **Utility Hooks**: 11 custom hooks for state management
- **Type Exports**: Comprehensive type system for external use
- **Module Organization**: Clean export structure with index file
- **Dependency Management**: Proper integration with existing systems
