## 🔧 Integration with Existing Codebase

### Dependencies Used
- Integrates with existing `Board.ts` and `Ship.ts` classes
- Uses type definitions from `src/lib/game/types.ts`
- Leverages naval design tokens from `src/styles/tokens/game.ts`
- Compatible with existing database schema

### API Compatibility
- Maintains compatibility with TASK-008 data structures
- Follows established patterns for game state management
- Uses existing validation interfaces
- Integrates with player and game state systems

## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Basic Implementation
```typescript
import { ShipPlacement } from '@/components/game'
import '@/styles/ship-placement.css'

<ShipPlacement
  player={gamePlayer}
  onPlacementComplete={(player) => console.log('Fleet ready!', player)}
  onPlacementProgress={(progress) => console.log('Progress:', progress)}
  gameMode="setup"
  allowAutoPlacement={true}
  showTutorialHints={false}
/>
```

### Advanced Configuration
```typescript
import {
  PlacementValidator,
  CollisionDetector,
  AutoPlacer
} from '@/lib/game/placement'

// Custom validation rules
const validator = new PlacementValidator(board, {
  allowAdjacentShips: false,
  enforceFleetComposition: true,
  minDistanceBetweenShips: 1
})

// Auto-placement with custom strategy
const autoplacer = new AutoPlacer(board, validator, collisionDetector, {
  strategy: 'strategic',
  maxAttempts: 500,
  timeoutMs: 3000
})
```
