# Enhanced Ship Placement UI - E2E Test Report

## Executive Summary

**Test Date**: September 15, 2025
**Test Framework**: Playwright
**Target**: localhost:3000/game

1. **Navigation** - Successfully navigates to /game
2. **Ship Palette** - At least one ship type visible
3. **Double-click Rotation** - Keyboard handler present
4. **Drag and Drop** - Event handlers registered
5. **Keyboard Shortcuts** - R and Escape keys respond
6. **Auto-Place** - Button is visible and clickable

### ‚ùå Failing Features (7/13)
1. **Placement UI** - "Deploy Your Fleet" text not found
2. **Interactive Grid** - Konva.js canvas or grid not rendering
3. **Ship Selection** - Cannot select ships from palette
4. **Hover Preview** - No preview functionality detected

  - However, no ships are actually placed (0 cells detected)
  - Function may not be working correctly

### 11. Clear All Functionality

- **Issue**: Clear/Reset button not visible

## Performance Observations

- **Page Load Time**: ~2 seconds
- **Interaction Response**: Immediate for available buttons
- **Rendering Issues**: Significant - core UI components not rendering

## Root Cause Analysis

Based on the test results, the issues appear to stem from:

1. **Component Not Mounting**: The KonvaShipPlacement component may not be mounting properly
2. **State Management Issue**: Game may not be transitioning to ship_placement phase
3. **Import/Export Problem**: Possible issue with component imports in GameFlow.tsx
4. **Canvas Initialization**: Konva.js canvas may be failing to initialize
5. **Fallback Grid Issue**: The DOM-based fallback grid is also not rendering

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Verify Component Mounting**
   - Check that KonvaShipPlacement is properly imported in GameFlow.tsx
   - Ensure game phase transitions to 'ship_placement'

2. **Debug Canvas Rendering**
   - Check browser console for Konva.js errors
   - Verify all Konva components are properly imported

3. **Fix Grid Display**
   - Ensure the InteractiveGrid fallback component renders
   - Check CSS classes are properly applied

4. **Complete Ship Palette**
   - All 5 ship types should be visible
   - Ensure ship data is properly loaded

5. **Add Instructions**
   - Display clear instructions for all interactions
   - Include keyboard shortcut documentation

### Code Areas to Review:

1. `/src/components/game/GameFlow.tsx` - Phase transition logic
2. `/src/components/placement/KonvaShipPlacement.tsx` - Main component
3. `/src/components/placement/KonvaPlacementBoard.tsx` - Grid rendering
4. `/src/hooks/placement/useKonvaPlacement.ts` - State management
5. `/src/stores/gameStore.ts` - Game phase management

## Screenshots

Test screenshots have been saved to `/test-screenshots/`:
- `01-initial-load.png` - Initial page load
- `02-after-start.png` - After game start attempt
- `03-placement-ui.png` - Placement UI state
- `04-after-placement.png` - After placement attempt
- `05-final-state.png` - Final test state

## Test Configuration

```typescript
// Playwright Configuration
- Browser: Chromium
- Viewport: 1280x720
- Timeout: 10s (actions), 30s (navigation)
- Screenshots: On failure
- Video: On failure
```

## Conclusion

The enhanced ship placement UI requires significant debugging to achieve full functionality. While the basic framework is in place (keyboard handlers, some buttons visible), the core interactive elements (grid, ship placement, drag-and-drop) are not operational. The primary issue appears to be with component mounting or state management preventing the placement UI from fully rendering.

### Priority Fix List:
1. üî¥ **CRITICAL**: Fix grid rendering (Konva or DOM fallback)
2. üî¥ **CRITICAL**: Ensure ship placement phase is reached
3. üü° **HIGH**: Complete ship palette with all 5 ships
4. üü° **HIGH**: Enable ship selection and placement
5. üü° **HIGH**: Add hover preview functionality
6. üü¢ **MEDIUM**: Add clear instructions
7. üü¢ **MEDIUM**: Implement rotation and drag features
8. üü¢ **MEDIUM**: Fix auto-place to actually place ships
